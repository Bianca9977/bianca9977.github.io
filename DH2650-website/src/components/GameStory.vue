                Game Story
            </h3>
            <p>
                The player awakens from inside a temple of primordial evil, where the cold, stone floor itself seems to vibrate erringly. 
                Dark wines cover the temple’s walls, growing rampantly and uncontrolled as no man has before entered the temple to tend them. 
                No living man that is. A maleficent blue-green smoke erupts from the cracks of the temple floor, here rests a curse that cannot be escaped, not even upon one’s death. 
                For when the player dies he finds himself again waking up within the ruined walls of the island’s evil temple. 
                The player must gather resources, engage in pitiless combat with the soulless victims of the island, explore in the island’s four directions, and ultimately defeat the evil entity inside, the evil deity known as Möbius. 
                Only then can the curse of Hau be surely lifted.
